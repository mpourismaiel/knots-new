## Security notice

**Please note:**
As with all software you install, you should verify you have downloaded the authentic program, and nobody has maliciously injected a virus.
Always verify the correct PGP signature on any downloads to avoid risk of malware.
Bitcoin Knots is signed by [Luke Dashjr's PGP key](luke-jr.asc).
You can (and should, if you don't already have it from another trusted source) download the key from at least two independent sources and ensure they match.
Luke's PGP key is [also available from bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/luke-jr.asc) (this can be your second source if you have nothing better).

SHA256 hashes of all downloads, signed by Luke Dashjr's PGP key, are available under the "digital signatures" link in the download box.
If this link is missing, broken, or fails to verify, do not trust the downloaded files, and [contact him](mailto:luke_bcknots_securitybreach@dashjr.org) immediately.
