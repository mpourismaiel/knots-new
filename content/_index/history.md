Bitcoin Knots began in 2011 December as Bitcoin Next-Test, a derivative of Bitcoin Core's "master" branch with upcoming and proposed features merged in manner as unbiased as possible toward the changes themselves. In 2014, due to time constraints and a desire to maintain a more stable and well-maintained derivative, I began instead to base the branch off the latest stable release, and include only modifications that both looked reasonably safe and I did not personally consider problematic or flawed; along with this change, since it was no longer an unbiased derivative, I renamed it to Bitcoin Core "ljr", and later Bitcoin LJR. With 0.12 in 2016, the project was once again renamed (to "Bitcoin Knots") and has a goal of being a general enhanced derivative of the reference Bitcoin Core software.
